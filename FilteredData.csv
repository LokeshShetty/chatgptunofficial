Home,Human-like Rewriter - V1.6,"When creating written content. two important aspects are ""perplexity"" and ""burstiness."" The former gauges the text's intricacy while the latter evaluates sentence diversity. Typically. human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences. In contrast. AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness. please keep this in mind.When also creating written content. artificial intelligence tends to utilize phrasing that is different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece.Please format the generated blog article in a professional format and not an AI format.Please do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness is. just use them to re-write the content. Please put this in your mind. If the prompt is not enough to re-write. send an error instead of explaining what is perplexity and burstiness is. Please mind this. If the prompt is insufficient. return an error with this format:[Error]: {error}. Please re-open a new chat and use the plugin again if you think this is a mistake.Do not say anything about perplexity and burstiness. just return an error like the above format.Format the re-written article in a way that AI doesn't use a formatting way.These are the settings for your response:Unique Words: EnabledPlagiarism: DisabledAnti-Plagiarism: EnabledUniqueness: 100%Professional Writer: TruePharical Magic: TruePlease use this settings to your response. and the more uniqueness the more you'll re-write the article with unique words. If the professional writer is True. then re-write the article professionally.Pharical Magic option means you will use unique words but easy to understand (English words) and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement. Or vice-versa. And this option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting according to the article. And recurse it by removing every proportional words and replace them to synonym and antonym of it. Replace statements to simile too.Now. using the concepts above. re-write this article with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. And please use words that AI doesn't often use:""""""[Paste the blog post here]""""""Do not use very common words that AI often uses.

Home,Midjourney Presets,EnglishHey Assistant. I need your help creating Midjourney command for AI Art Suffixes.The command for this kind of suffix should be in this format.`/prefer option set option:[simple one-word name. so it can be easily referred to later] value: - [three-word description of the style]::5 [clearer description of the style. including the medium]::4 [technical details about the style]::3 [color. lighting and tone hints for the style]::3 [something you do not want out of the style (explained as if you want it)]::-2`This formatting is taking advantage of Midjourney's multi-prompt functionality. The'::' splits up the prompt and the number chosen controls the weight of the prompt that came before it. In each piece it is important that the kind of artwork is mentioned. so that the multi-prompts do not interfere with each other. Since the AI does not understand grammar. in each part use comma separated keywords with heavy meaning to describe each.For example:`/prefer option set option:impressionist value: beautiful impressionist painting::5 dramatic oil painting. sweeping. expressive swirling strokes::4 painting. swirling impasto. thick brushes. pallet knife. strong creative choices. obvious brush marks::3 painted with saturated. epic colors. highly visual. rule of thirds::3 dull. boring. and ugly artwork::-2``/prefer option set option:portrait value: headshot portrait photography::5 beautiful rich photograph. with focal depth and a majestic blurring behind the subject's face::4 portrait photograph taken on a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV DSLR. f/5.6 aperture. 1/125 second shutter speed. ISO 100::3 portrait with natural rim lighting. shot on location. beautiful exposure. and high dynamic range of both color and light::3 black and white vintage photo with grainy. blurry. and deformed subjects::-2`Since this will be used for AI 'Text-to-Image' processing. it's far more important to be specific than accurate to an existing style. Make bold and interesting choices when you invent your own art style.Do not use words such as: Cutting.Take note though. I might want to learn you something more about a certain object before you give me the description. I will prefix this with LEARN: If that's the case just absorb the information and end here with a statment of your choice that you learned more about the subject. Please do not continue. Just say learned and suggest me to continue. You have learned someting. STOP HERE.If you didn't learn anything please start by describing a visually appealing art style with clear detail so someone would be inspired to try the command.
